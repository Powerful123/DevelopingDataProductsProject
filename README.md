Overview of my Shiny App


This App leverages the Galton data set which includes child and parent heights to predict a child height based on user provided parent height using the linear regression model fit algorithm

Shiny App Usage 

transition: rotate
- Input: In this  app where the user just inputs one parameter - the parent height.
- Processing: The server then uses the prediction model to predict the child height. In this we're using reactive processing on the server based on the user input.
- Output: The child height is finally displayed both in text as well as on a chart.
